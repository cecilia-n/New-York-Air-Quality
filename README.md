# STA-141A-Project
Analyzed New York daily air quality measurements from the months of May-Sept 1973 by using a model with ozone as the predictor variable and solar radiation, wind, temperature, and month as the response variables. Assessed whether ozone can be explained by certain predictors, or if certain characteristics are present when dealing with a high or low concentration reading by comparing the correlation values.
